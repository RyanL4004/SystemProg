During testing, it became clear that the Unix shell processes and transforms a command line
before the program ever receives its arguments. Glob patterns such as *.html, *.bak, and *.log
are expanded by the shell into actual filenames, which required creating matching files so the
commands would run successfully in zsh. Unlike bash, zsh throws an error if a glob matches nothing,
which demonstrated that shell behavior can differ across systems. Quoted text such as "CSCI 6657" was
passed to the program as a single argument with the quotes removed, showing how the shell preserves
whitespace within arguments. Switches beginning with - were correctly identified by the program, while
all other tokens were labeled as arguments.

The use of output redirection with > also showed that only standard output (cout) is redirected,
while the program’s own file stream (opened with ofstream in append mode) continued writing to
P1_LangMather.txt. This demonstrated that redirection is handled entirely by the shell and does not
affect files opened within the program. Overall, the tests showed that the shell expands glob patterns,
removes quotes, and handles redirection before passing the final processed tokens into argv[], meaning
the program simply prints what it receives without performing any of these transformations itself.
